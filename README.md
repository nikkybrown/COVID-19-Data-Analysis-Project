             #COVID-19 Data Analysis Project
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the world, resulting in significant loss of lives and widespread disruptions to societies. This project is focused on the analysis of sample data related to COVID-19 cases recorded between January 2019 and December 2020. The dataset is provided in CSV format.

         Introduction
This project aims to analyze COVID-19 data for the period between January 2019 and December 2020. It involves the following steps:
 Establish a robust structured  PostgreSQL database named 'covid_19_data'.
Create a table within the 'covid_19_data' database named 'covid_19_data' to store the dataset.
Use a Python script to procure the 'Covid_19_data.csv' file and load it into the PostgreSQL database.
Employ PostgreSQL PG4 Admin for the creation and execution of SQL queries.

   
   Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
Pandas
SQLALchemy
Python 3.x
PostgreSQL
PG4 Admin

   Setting Up the Database
To set up the PostgreSQL database and create a table for the COVID-19 data, follow these steps:
Open PG4 Admin and connect to your PostgreSQL server.
Connect to the PostgreSQL database 'engine.connect()' method establishes and returns a connection object (conn) to the PostgreSQL database. You can then use this connection object to interact with the database.
Load the data into the table df.to_sql('covid_19_data',con=engine,if_exists='replace') with the desired table name in the PostgreSQL database. The if_exists='replace' argument ensures that the table is created and replaces it if it already exists.
 
  from sqlalchemy import create_engine
  engine=create_engine("postgresql://user_name:password@localhost:5432/covid_19_data")
  engine.connect()
  
    This script will create a table called 'covid_19_data' in your PostgreSQL database and load the data from the CSV file into that table.
Create a new database named 'covid_19_data' if it doesn't already exist.
Within the 'covid_19_data' database, create a table named 'covid_19_data' with appropriate columns to store the COVID-19 data.
    
    Data Loading
To load the COVID-19 data into the 'covid_19_data' table, use the provided Python script. You can execute the script using the following command:
python %load_ext sql
Make sure to modify the script to connect to your PostgreSQL database and specify the location of the 'Covid_19_data.csv' file.

    Data Analysis
This project provides a basic framework for analyzing the COVID-19 data. You can extend it to perform various analyses based on your research questions and objectives.

   Queries
All SQL queries used for data analysis are provided in the 'covid_data_analysis.py' file. You can execute these queries in PG4 Admin to retrieve insights and generate reports based on the COVID-19 data.
